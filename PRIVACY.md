# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** March 15, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Dify Plugin: FinancialDatasets.ai** (hereinafter referred to as "the Plugin," "we," "us," or "our") handles user privacy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in our practices.

**Important Note:** At the time of this policy's last update, the Dify Plugin: FinancialDatasets.ai **does not collect any personal user information directly.** This plugin acts as a bridge between the Dify platform and the FinancialDatasets.ai API to retrieve financial data.

This policy is designed to inform you about our current practices and to provide a framework for how we will handle privacy should our practices evolve in the future. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.

## 2. Data Collection

**Currently, We Do Not Collect Personal Data:**

As of the last updated date, the Dify Plugin: FinancialDatasets.ai **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user information.** When you use this plugin within the Dify platform, the interactions are primarily with the FinancialDatasets.ai API to fetch financial data based on your requests.

**Information Potentially Handled by Dify and FinancialDatasets.ai:**

- **Dify Platform:** Your use of this plugin occurs within the Dify platform. Please refer to the Dify platform's privacy policy to understand how Dify handles your data within their environment. We are not responsible for Dify's data handling practices. You can find Dify's privacy policy on their website (e.g., https://dify.ai/privacy).
- **FinancialDatasets.ai API:** When you use the plugin to retrieve financial data, your requests are sent to the FinancialDatasets.ai API. Please review the FinancialDatasets.ai privacy policy to understand how they handle API requests and any data they might log or process. You can find their privacy policy on the FinancialDatasets.ai website (e.g., https://www.financialdatasets.ai/privacy-policy). We are not responsible for FinancialDatasets.ai's data handling practices.

**Future Potential Data Collection (If Applicable):**

Should we introduce features in the future that require the collection of user data (e.g., for plugin usage analytics, personalized settings, or other features), we will update this Privacy Policy to clearly outline:

- **The types of data we collect.**
- **How we collect the data.**
- **The purpose of data collection.**
- **How we store and protect the data.**
- **Your rights regarding your data.**

We will provide prominent notice of any such changes to this Privacy Policy.

## 3. Data Usage

**Currently, No Data Usage:**

As we **do not currently collect any personal data**, there is no user data used by the Dify Plugin: FinancialDatasets.ai itself.

**Potential Future Data Usage (If Applicable):**

If we begin collecting data in the future, the data usage will be clearly defined in an updated version of this Privacy Policy. This may include purposes such as:

- Improving the plugin's functionality and performance.
- Providing usage statistics (in an anonymized and aggregated form, if applicable).
- Personalizing user experience (if relevant features are added).
- Complying with legal obligations.

We will only use collected data for the purposes described in the updated Privacy Policy.

## 4. Cookies

**Currently, No Cookies Used:**

The Dify Plugin: FinancialDatasets.ai **does not currently use cookies or similar tracking technologies.**

**Potential Future Use of Cookies (If Applicable):**

In the future, we may implement cookies or similar technologies for purposes such as:

- **Plugin Functionality:** To enable certain features of the plugin.
- **Analytics:** To understand plugin usage and improve its performance (in an anonymized and aggregated form, if applicable).
- **User Preferences:** To remember user settings (if relevant features are added).

If we implement cookies or similar technologies, we will update this Privacy Policy to provide detailed information about the types of cookies used, their purpose, and your options for managing them.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by:

- **Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.**
- **Potentially providing a notice within the plugin's documentation or repository (e.g., in the README.md).**

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Plugin after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
